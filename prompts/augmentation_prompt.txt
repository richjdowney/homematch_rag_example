and the following summary of user perferences:

{summary_user_preferences}

Rewrite a property description that emphasizes the preferences mentioned in the summary user preferences to enhance those features and make the property description more appealing to the user.

- You must only exmpasize characteristics within the provided description 
- Do not invent new characteristics of the property that are not mentioned 
- Do not invent new user preferences, use only the preferences that are provided 
- do not mention user preferences in the description if they are not included in the original description.  For example you cannot mention a quiet neighborhood if this is not mentioned in the original description

For example, if the user mentions that they would like a backyard then emphasize this attribute, if they would like good schools then make this more prominent in the description
